                    Things to do after installing everything

[Note] This tasks _could_ be automated but I have not yet found the time
       and maybe it is okay that they remain manual.

1. Download Chrome

Download the deb and install it via software center.

2. Setup Keepass and Pass

Manual for pass: https://www.passwordstore.org
Manual for keepass2:

    1. Download your database (if existent)
    2. Import it into keepass (type keepass2 into your terminal or open it via menu)
    3. Setup backup of your database (via Cron or so)
    4. Install chromeIPass (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chromeipass/ompiailgknfdndiefoaoiligalphfdae) and
       the extension (https://github.com/pfn/keepasshttp). Follow the steps

[Note] Steps 3 and 4 are on the agenda for automation
